The Feminist Principles of the Internet are a series of statements that offer a gender and sexual rights lens on critical Internet-related rights.

There are 17 principles in total, organised into 5 clusters:

- Access
- Movements
- Economy
- Expression
- [Embodiment](embodiment.md)

They aim to provide a framework for women's movements to articulate and explore issues related to technology.
