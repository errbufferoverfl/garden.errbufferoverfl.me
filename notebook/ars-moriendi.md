The Ars Moriendi (The Art of Dying) is a Mediaeval Christian death manual that appeared around the middle of the fifteenth century. The text is understood to be a response to the devastation of the Black Death.

The book basically gave people instructions of how to die in a way that ensured they made it to heaven because there were so many dead or missing priests.
