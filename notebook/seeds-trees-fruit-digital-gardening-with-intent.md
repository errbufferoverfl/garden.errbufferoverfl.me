## Ethos

- Digital gardening should support and reward reclaiming time rather than being organised by it.

- Digital gardening should support iterative learning and adjustment from conclusion as needed.

- Digital gardens should reject the concept of becoming a digital utopia. Utopias ignore the periods of rot, weeds and even death that are naturally part of every ecosystem.

- Digital gardens embrace and celebrate that gardens and gardeners are ever-changing and complex. The design of a garden evolves to adapt and values complexity.

- Digital gardens are the commons can be managed for individual and collective benefit, this does not disclude holding safety at the fore-front.

### Seeds

Seeds are your initial thoughts or ideas about a topic or concept. They are short and are like a scratchpad to temporarily support working memory.

### Trees

Represent you knowledge is forming new branches and connecting dots. Trees are short structured notes that articulate a specific idea.

### Fruit

Fruit is new work that is more substantial in nature â€” essays, videos, tutorials or maybe some day a book or zine! Who knows!
