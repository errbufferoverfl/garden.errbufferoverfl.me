The "state" is a centralised political organisation that imposes and enforces rules over a population within a territory.

::: {.callout-warning}
Definitions of state are disputed and can vary depending on context and audience.
:::

Walter Scheidel an Austrian historian maintains that most modern definitions of the state have the following in common:

- Centralised institutions that impose rules;
- Back these rules up by force;
- Within a territoriality circumscribed population;
- With a distinction between the rulers and the ruled;
- Includes an element of autonomy, stability, and differentiation.
