*In the nineteenth century, English textile workers responded to the introduction of new technologies on the factory floor by smashing them to bits. For years the Luddites roamed the English countryside, practicing drills and manoeuvres that they would later deploy on unsuspecting machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history; for Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of the antagonistic relationship between all workers, including us today, and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The Luddites weren’t primitive and they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the twenty-first century world.*

*Breaking Things at Work is an innovative rethinking of labour and machines, leaping from textile mills to algorithms, from existentially threatened knife cutters of rural Germany to surveillance-evading truckers driving across the continental United States. Mueller argues that the future stability and empowerment of working-class movements will depend on subverting these technologies and preventing their spread wherever possible. The task is intimidating, but the seeds of this resistance are already present in the neo-Luddite efforts of hackers, pirates, and dark web users who are challenging surveillance and control, often through older systems of communication technology.*

## Quotes

> ... technology has separated us from some kind of essential part of ourselves, that it alienates us from what makes us really human.
> -- Introduction, pg. 11

> ... the more fundamental problem of technology is its role in the reproduction of hierarchies and injustices foisted upon most of us by business owners, bosses, and governments.
> -- Introduction, pg. 12

> ... Their [Luddites] militant opposition to machines has meant that their legacy has been understood as a king of technophobia... the Luddites have become synonymous with an irrational fear of inevitable progress.
> -- The Nights of King Ludd, pg. 16

> The wealthy and powerful understood machine as a method to accumulate power, and so too did the toiling classes over whom they wished to exert it.
> -- The Nights of King Ludd, pg. 9

> "For us, as Marx long ago, the working class is defined by its struggle against capital and not [mearly] by its productive function"
> -- The Nights of King Ludd, pg. 14

> Sometimes an enthusiasm for technology is thought to be an expression of begrudging admiration for the bourgeoisie, often joined by a larger claim that capitalism is a necessary stage on the path to socialism.
> -- The Nights of King Ludd, pg. 20

> Many writers on the radical left have accepted this framing of automation, and even extended and detourned its implications, making "full automation" central to the transcendence of capitalist exploitation.
> -- Against Automation, pg. 3

> ...their predictions rely on a faulty understanding of what actually happens when machines are introduced into production processes.
> -- Against Automation, pg. 5

> Why does automation polarize instead of outright replace jobs? For one, many jobs require labor that is challenging to automate. Computers have to follow instructions laid out by programmers, so in order to substitute a computer for a worker, the worker's tasks must be understood and articulated.However, much of the labor process is encompassed in tacit knowledge that workers are unable to articulate...
> -- Against Automation, pg. 6
