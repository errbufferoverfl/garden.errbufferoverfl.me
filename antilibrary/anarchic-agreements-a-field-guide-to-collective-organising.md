*A new world is possible and not just in our hearts. Anarchic Agreements is a quintessential field guide for the revolution, answering the practical questions often left out of works of political theory and philosophy.*

- *How do leaderless groups organise?*
- *How might they create constitutions, balance power and write protocols?*
- *How do group cultures and institutions maintain coalitions?*

*This urgent and inspiring how-to is the product of more than twenty years of research. Designed explicitly for everyday use, it contains lived examples, illustrations throughout, and text from current horizontally organized constitutions. These documents illustrate the never-ending process of developing community and keeping collaborations alive in the fairest ways possible.*

*Written by dedicated anarchist scholars and organizers, and based on the widely popular Anarchic Agreements pamphlet series, this book facilitates grassroots activism and provides methods to improve and streamline decision making. It is an inspiring celebration of the novel, complex and flexible constitutions Anarchists have date over time. This book shows how to realize another world, collectively without domination, while leaving the future open to infinite other possibilities.*

## High-Level Thoughts

Good book to read image to image, but ultimately better as a reference, this book is a practical guide to building durable, fair and coercion free groups and coalitions. It won't tell you how-to in the traditional sense but provides the tools needed to determine how to.

## Summary Notes

Constitutions aren't static documents (nor do they need to be written documents!), they are (or should be) constantly revised. They define "rules" (social norms?) of a community and divide power into visible subgroups so that it's not all concentrated within one group of people, i.e., cliques, or friendship groups.

Supporting the process of constitutionalising doesn't imply that anarchists need to support or defend the constitution of state and nation. But we should acknowledge that a constitution in a group or coalition can be helpful in defining our understanding of right and wrong, and balancing power.

The difference with constitutions backed by [the state](/notebook/the-state.md) is not only are they remain fixed and difficult to change even when our ideas of equality, equity and material power change. This is compounded by the fact the state often uses coercive controls to keep people from contesting or challenging the existing constitution.

Modern constitutions represent the interests of the most powerful individuals and groups in society and changing these constitutions means changing the interests of the most powerful -- which is unlikely to happen especially if as part of redefining the constitution their power and privilege is reduced, redistributed or removed.

Having a constitution, or a constitutional process is not the same as democracy, and democracy isn't always antithetical to the constitution of a society.

### Building Durable Groups

A constitution, weather written or not should aim to create a shared understanding of whom the group is, and how they do things. (Similar to a team working agreement?). A good anarchic constitution must be: **consensual**, **changeable**, and **conscious**.

**Consensual** doesn't mean being told what to do, to have a proper consensual agreement, everyone should be able to shape the agreement, or at the least have their needs taken into account.

Protracted meetings about policies can lead to a group losing people who are keen to get things done, it's important to find compromise [Consensus and Humming in the IETF](/engineering/consensus-and-humming-in-the-ietf.md) provides a method of creating rough consensus that I think is applicable here.

Constitutions should be revised regularly, cadence can be decided by the group but it can be tied to key events, like new people joining, established members leaving etc., it could also be regularly updated as established members update their views and/or circumstances change.

Constitutions and building consensus should be balanced with group stability and and having all views reflected, for example:

> An anti-nuclear power group wouldn't be expected to become pro-nuclear because someone joined the group and said they didn't agree with what it is all about.

So while a group might not change their principals, they might be flexible about how those principals are achieved, for example:

> A group that is committed to a non-hierarchical structure might think carefully about before introducing a system of elected leaders to expedite decision-making. But they might experiment with different models to vote on issues.

What I see as the most important of these principals is being conscious of "decisions" being made -- it's often the case that a group is formed around a vibe, and so things like aim, purpose and value are never discussed which can result in more conflict further on.

Focusing on a shared vibe while powerful also leads in unclear expectations and over time lead to ad-hoc decision-making which can fragment establishing members and contribute to burn out.

But similar things can be said for making practical decisions -- a group can slide into habits that shape how a team or group function over time.

While this can affect **everyone** in a group, when it comes to groups where there is an over-representation of men it can result in a lot of the day to day operational work being done by people read as women, al. la "[glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue)".

Having conscious conversations about how labour is divided means it's possible to consider the implications of different options and choose the one that works best.

Conscious decisions are easier to communicate to new members -- it can shape the development of a clear responsibility model and means messaging will be consistent, which in turn makes it easier to hand over if someone else takes over the job.

Less-conscious decisions on the other hand will favour those already empowered by the group -- e.g., if you're an establishing member or you're more confident in your position in a group you're likely going to explain group dynamics within that context.

Conscious decision-making is balancing act -- if you're empowered, you're also likely to put forward your views, fight for your ideals, and perhaps assume that if no one disagreed your suggestion was agreed to.

As important as it is for others to speak up, it's just as important, if not more important for the empowered to step back.

**Helpful tools:** Roles and Responsibilities, Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed (RACI) Matrix, Team Working Agreements, Ritual Resets.

**What is the group?** What is the purpose, and what are our aims? What principals and values do we share? What do we need to do to achieve our aims? Who can join the group?

In this set of questions I also like to ask: how do we make trade offs? This is sometimes imaged under principals and values but I like to take to about them as tenets and frame them as statements that show how they are applied.

**How are decisions made?** Do we use full consensus, rough consensus or vote? Who needs to be involved in what kind of decisions? What decisions need to be made at regular meetings and what can be decided outside regular meetings?

**How do we get things done?** How often do we meet? Are there regular social events? How do we communicate with each other outside of meetings? How do we communicate with people outside of the group? Are subgroups or individuals responsible for certain tasks?

**How do we manage operational security?** How do we share passwords and secrets? How can people outside our group identify a communication is from us? How do we communicate securely among ourselves?

**What policies do we need?** How will we respond if someone makes a complaint to the group? Is there a system that would make it harder to steal group funds?

**How can we make the group empowered?** Are there groups of people who are likely to be empowered/dis-empowered in the group? What checks and balances can we introduce to make sure no one subgroup gains too much influence? What can we do to make it easier for people who are currently marginalised to take on roles and help shape the group?

Consider creating systems to reduce barriers to people getting involved: a stipend or paying for baby-sitting so parents can attend more easily, picking venues more consciously, so they are accessible. Picking issues affecting the most affected.
