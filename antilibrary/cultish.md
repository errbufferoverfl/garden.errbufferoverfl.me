_The author of the widely praised Wordslut analyzes the social science of cult influence: how cultish groups from Jonestown and Scientology to SoulCycle and social media gurus use language as the ultimate form of power. What makes “cults” so intriguing and frightening? What makes them powerful? The reason why so many of us binge Manson documentaries by the dozen and fall down rabbit holes researching suburban moms gone QAnon is because we’re looking for a satisfying explanation for what causes people to join—and more importantly, stay in—extreme groups._

_We secretly want to know: could it happen to me? Amanda Montell’s argument is that, on some level, it already has . . . Our culture tends to provide pretty flimsy answers to questions of cult influence, mostly having to do with vague talk of “brainwashing.” But the true answer has nothing to do with freaky mind-control wizardry or Kool-Aid. In Cultish, Montell argues that the key to manufacturing intense ideology, community, and us/them attitudes all comes down to language._ 

_In both positive ways and shadowy ones, cultish language is something we hear—and are influenced by—every single day. Through juicy storytelling and cutting original research, Montell exposes the verbal elements that make a wide spectrum of communities “cultish,” revealing how they affect followers of groups as notorious as Heaven’s Gate, but also how they pervade our modern start-ups, Peloton leaderboards, and Instagram feeds. Incisive and darkly funny, this enrapturing take on the curious social science of power and belief will make you hear the fanatical language of “cultish” everywhere._

### Initial Thoughts

Amanda Montell is a language scholar who has worked on similar books before so I'm expecting the book to be very linguistic oriented. From the book summary I'm expecting the book explores the "suburban mom gone QAnon" pipeline in more detail, rather than glossing over _how_ people are radicalised. 

I'm also pleased to see that Montell's research won't just focus on what we see or understand as religious or political "cults", but will also explore how cultish language is used by start-ups, fitness brands and social media.

Based on the table of contents I suspect the structure will be very similar to the Netflix series *How to Become a Cult Leader*.

## Chapter 1: Repeat After Me

**What is a cult?**

It depends.

Originally cults meant nothing more that "homage paid to divinity"[^1] in the modern day the term cult is considered pejorative.

It wasn't until the Fourth Great Awakening[^2] that cult began to take on a more sinister meaning due to the Manson family, which was followed not long after by Johnstown and consequently Heavens Gate.

These events helped drive the "satanic panic" in the 1980s. The Satanic Panic also saw over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse. While it has it's roots in the US, it spread throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and still persists today.

**So, *how* do we define a cult?**

**What's the difference between a cult and religion?**

Very little and it's a question as old as religion itself. Burton likes to focus on what religion does rather than what they are. Religions provide: meaning, purpose, a sense of community and ritual.

See how there isn't much difference between the two?

**Why do we enjoy consuming tales about cultish groups?**

Your amygdala,[^3] the part of the brain that controls emotions, memory, and survival tactics basically gets aroused by disaster.  It enables the part of our brain that controls problem-solving and basically tries to work out if you are in direct danger… this in turn puts you into flight, flight and fawn mode and you're just like watching Netflix, or reading a book.

**Why do people join these groups?**

People may find themself being drawn into cultish endeavours due to the "epidemic of loneliness". Cultish endeavours wether they are based in religion, fitness, a product, or something else entirely can give us a sense of belonging. They can soften the burden of having to make so many independent choices associated with crafting your own "personal brand".

Our first interviewee is a first-generation Russian American who struggled to fit in during childhood. As a young adult she found solace in a local Yoga studio that advocated from abstaining from meat and alcohol.[^4]

3HO's leader Yogi Bhajan was post-humorously investigated for sexual abuse charges.

**Is everyone susceptible to cultish influence?**

Yes, and I feel like a part of it is because of the overconfidence effect[^5] 

## Part 2: Congratulations — You Have Been Chosen to Joint the Next Evolutionary Level Above Human

**What makes people join groups like Jonestown and Heavens Gate? And more importantly, what makes them stay?**

**What makes people in cultish-groups do things they may not do normally? e.g., Heaven's Gate members sterilised themselves.**

**How did Jim Jones convince the people of Jonestown to commit mass suicide?**

**Who were their primary targets for indoctrination? What were the similarities/differences?**

**What can we learn from Jonestown and Heaven't Gate to protect ourselves from cultish groups?**

**What is the demographic distribution amongst leaders of cultish groups?**

**How do their target demographics differ?**

**What differences can we see in leaders of cultish groups that are women?**

**What is the Sapir-Worf hypothesis?**

Also known as linguistic relativity it's a principle that suggests that the structure of language influences its speakers worldview and thus it their perceptions of the world.

[^2]: The Fourth Great Awakening was a Christian awakening that some scholars say took place in the United States either in the late 1960s and early 1970s or the era after World War II. The terminology is controversial as some historians argue that the "awakening" was vastly different to the prior three.

Sikh Dharma International and its associated corporate entities and directors created and control the [Yogi Tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Tea "Yogi Tea") and [Akal Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akal_Security "Akal Security").
