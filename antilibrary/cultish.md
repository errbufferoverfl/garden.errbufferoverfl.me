_The author of the widely praised Wordslut analyzes the social science of cult influence: how cultish groups from Jonestown and Scientology to SoulCycle and social media gurus use language as the ultimate form of power. What makes “cults” so intriguing and frightening? What makes them powerful? The reason why so many of us binge Manson documentaries by the dozen and fall down rabbit holes researching suburban moms gone QAnon is because we’re looking for a satisfying explanation for what causes people to join—and more importantly, stay in—extreme groups._

_We secretly want to know: could it happen to me? Amanda Montell’s argument is that, on some level, it already has . . . Our culture tends to provide pretty flimsy answers to questions of cult influence, mostly having to do with vague talk of “brainwashing.” But the true answer has nothing to do with freaky mind-control wizardry or Kool-Aid. In Cultish, Montell argues that the key to manufacturing intense ideology, community, and us/them attitudes all comes down to language._ 

_In both positive ways and shadowy ones, cultish language is something we hear—and are influenced by—every single day. Through juicy storytelling and cutting original research, Montell exposes the verbal elements that make a wide spectrum of communities “cultish,” revealing how they affect followers of groups as notorious as Heaven’s Gate, but also how they pervade our modern start-ups, Peloton leaderboards, and Instagram feeds. Incisive and darkly funny, this enrapturing take on the curious social science of power and belief will make you hear the fanatical language of “cultish” everywhere._

### Initial Thoughts

Amanda Montell is a language scholar who has worked on similar books before so I'm expecting the book to be very linguistic oriented.

From the book summary I'm expecting the book explores the "suburban mom gone QAnon" pipeline in more detail, rather than glossing over _how_ people are radicalised. 

I'm also pleased to see that Montell's research won't just focus on what we see or understand as religious or political cults, but will also explore how cult language is used by start-ups, fitness brands and social media.

After watching a few series and documentaries about cults you can see the same patterns in emerge but at the same time it's very easy to second guess wether you're reading too much into it.

Based on the table of contents I suspect the structure will be very similar to the Netflix series *How to Become a Cult Leader*. 

- **Chapter 2 Congratulations — You Have Been Chosen to Joint the Next Evolutionary Level Above Human** has big Heavens Gate themes.
- **Chapter 3 Even YOU Can Learn to Speak in Tongues** gives me the impression we might touch on Jim Jones and his use of code switching to get people involved in the Jonestown cult.
- **Part 4 Do You Wanna Be a # BossBabe** sounds like we'll be exploring the "cult" of at the intersection of grind culture, leaning in and feminist ideology — multi-level marketing!
- **Part 5 This Hour is Going to Change Your Life… and Make You LOOK AWESOME** looks like it'll be covering the fitness industry and how they tap into our psyche the way cults do.
- **Part 6 Follow for Follow** feels like it'll be more social media and perhaps Instagram? focused, given I don't really use the platform I'm not too sure what cultish dark-patterns are used on the site.

There are a fair few references and notes! There look to be some really interesting references to Jim Jones and Scientology that I feel like will be worth digging into as part of reading this book.
