_'Work hard, get paid.' It's simple. Self-evident. But it's also a lie—at least for most of us. For young people today, the old assumptions are crumbling; hard work in school no longer guarantees a secure, well-paying job in the future. Far from equating to riches and fulfilment, 'work' increasingly means precarity, anxiety and alienation._
  
_Amelia Horgan poses three big questions: what is work? How does it harm us? And what can we do about it? Along the way, she explores the many facets of work under capitalism: its encroachment on our personal lives; the proliferation of temporary and zero-hours contracts; burnout; and how different jobs are gendered or racialized._
  
_While abolishing work altogether is not the answer, _Lost in Work_ shows that when workers are able to take control of their workplaces, they become less miserable, and even open doors allowing them to fight back against the elite._
