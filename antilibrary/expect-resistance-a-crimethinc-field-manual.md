_Expect Resistance is not one but three books, each of which may be read as a complete work unto itself. The first book, printed in standard black ink, continues the inquiry into modern life and its discontents begun in [Days of War, Nights of Love](https://crimethinc.com/books/days-of-war-nights-of-love). Just as that book included improved versions of texts originally published between 1996 and 1999, this book draws on CrimethInc. material from 2000 to 2004, painstakingly refined and augmented with a great deal of new content. The second book, in red ink, is a composite account, related by three narrators, of the adventures and tribulations that inevitably ensue when people pursuing their dreams enter into conflict with the world as it is._

_Together these comprise a third book, an exploration of the complex relationship between ideals and reality. Expect Resistance is a field manual for a field on which all manuals are useless, a meditation on individual transformation and collective resistance in disastrous times, and a masterpiece that raises the bar for radical publishing._

## High-Level Thoughts

In the past few days I've found myself at a bit of a crossroads with this book. While I know it's brimming with tales of anarchy and camaraderie, the message within these pages requires a receptive mind and I'm just not _there_ yet.

So, dear book, rest assured I will return and retrace my steps. But for now, I'm going to bid you farewell.

## Summary Notes

Ten thousand generation have dreamed of flying but in the modern day we need movies to numb the boredom we experience this feat. Perhaps because now, nearly 240 years later we're so emotionally insulated from the adventure of flying we've lost the sensation and joy of experiencing the landscape below, deprived of the sensation of being airborne.

When breaking apart from the status quo you will need to fight off every conviction instilled in you since childhood that those who don't play their part in society are failures.

The author recounts a story of dropping a coffee machine off of an eleven story building, noting a pedestrian lurched back as it hit the ground and this was _not_ a vibe. No ones desire to be liberated should come at the expense of hitting a random person with a fucking coffee machine.

Our modern indulgences are crafted by external factors rather than our own, for example: we like fast food because we have to hurry back to work, it disrupts the brain-gut axis, and we're so busy and stressed we can't justify enjoying the festivity in cooking and eating.
