*"A startling exposé of the invisible human workforce that powers the web--and how to bring it out of the shadows. Hidden beneath the surface of the internet, a new, stark reality is looming--one that cuts to the very heart of our endless debates about the impact of AI.*

*Anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri unveil how the services we use from companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Uber can only function smoothly thanks to the judgment and experience of a vast human labor force that is kept deliberately concealed. The people who do 'ghost work' make the internet seem smart. They perform high-tech, on-demand piecework: flagging X-rated content, proofreading, transcribing audio, confirming identities, captioning video, and much more. The shameful truth is that no labor laws protect them or even acknowledge their existence.*

*They often earn less than legal minimums for traditional work, they have no health benefits, and they can be fired at any time for any reason, or for no reason at all. An estimated 8 percent of Americans have worked in this 'ghost economy,' and that number is growing every day. In this unprecedented investigation, Gray and Suri make the case that robots will never completely eliminate 'ghost work' and the unchecked quest for artificial intelligence could spark catastrophic work conditions if not stopped in its tracks. Ultimately, they show how this essential type of work can create opportunity--rather than misery--for those who do it."*

## Other Notes

Grey notes within the first few pages that on-demand work isn't inherently good or bad, a sentiment I disagree with, in later pages, she talks about how people working in ghost work often have this sense of urgency to not only accept a job,[^1] but to complete the task accurately or risk losing income. To me this aligns to the \[\[white supremacy\]\] cultural habit.[^2] We see that by applying this sense of urgency it perpetuates a power imbalance between employee and employer while disconnecting ghost workers from their need to pause and reflect, which would guarantee a higher success rate and the need for companies to pay them more.

Ignoring wether Grey thinks this work is good or bad, one thing we know for certain is, like we've seen in the Australian fruit and vegetable picking industry, paying by weight picked, or in this case by task is ripe for abuse.

AWU Nation Secretary Dan Walton on fruit picking:[^3] \> "The problem is too many farmers have become addicted to underpayment and exploitation as a normal part of doing business. This model isn't inevitable in Australia, it's just the one we've chosen in Australia,"

In the same way as fruit picking in Australia, it's not that the technology industry *can't* find better ways to solve the problem they have just become addicted **and** dependent on the exploitation of people throughout the supply chain to provide their boards with record profits\[\^citation-needed\].

Grey reports that \[\[FAANG\]\] companies often use ghost work to remove as much "not safe for work" content from their platform, for me the call out and an important distinction here is that it's not safe for **work**, not, not safe for people, which begs the question why are we investing so much money into sanitising the Internet? (That's a rhetorical question).

Within the first few pages Grey has already set the scene for this book -- there is the general understanding that this work is **important** and **valuable** to the usability of the platform but the associated monetary value is low. I mean it is exactly like how we value \[\[../the-notebook/reproductive-labor\|reproductive labor\]\].

On page xiv of the introduction, Grey says: \> Unlike CPUs, humans have agency: they make their own decisions.

And while I understand the general sentiment she is getting at, I disagree because when you live in a society that values rugged individualism and limits the basic opportunities people have, they don't have significant self-determination. It becomes something that only the privileged have.

Companies rely on an assembly line of workers to satisfy customers **who have grown to expect responses to their requests within seconds**.

Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Larry Page are people who have expressed panic about Ai or have revealed in a time "before Ai" when people "controlled their destiny". But one must ask if humans especially humans who live in states that have dismantled welfare were ever really in control of their destiny or if this notion of destiny is just something reserved for the people who have time and money to pursue "destiny".

Foxconn, who make iPhones apparently replaced 60,000 humans with robots in 2016.[^4]

In 2016, Amazon's 20 fulfilment centres apparently deployed 45, 00 robots to work alongside 230,000 people. In 2019, Amazon started rolling out machines to automate boxing up customer orders.[^5]

Robots and automations often allow employers to have what they want, when they want it, which allows them to avoid navigating the the problems of negotiating with employees for better, safer working conditions. It also means they no longer need to deal with the classification of types of work, or engaging with the employment laws that are protecting humans.

Dismantling employment on the surface sounds positive, but this is occurring along side the dismantling of the \[\[welfare state\]\], which encourages this value of \[\[../the-notebook/rugged-individualism\]\].

We're also seeing years of global reform be undone, from child labor laws,[^6] [^7]to workplace safety guidelines.[^8]

JPMorgan Chase Institute found 4.3% of U.S adults (10.73 million people) had worked an online-platform-economy job at least once between 2015 and 2016. The jobs provide no professional title, no ladder to climb, no bonuses, and no guarantees.

Gray talks about the thing that is common with all the people she interviewed was their *hope*;

-   Their hope to use on-demand jobs to control when they work, who they work with, and what tasks they take on.
-   The hope to avoid long commutes and hostile work environments.
-   They hope to gain experiences that refreshes their resume or opens the door to new possibilities.

Gray interviewed a bunch of people some looking to starve off boredom, or pay for weddings, younger siblings degrees, and in line with previous observations, disabled and retired folks looking for alternative routes to employment or making extra money to pad their social security checks.

-   Mechanical Turk (MTurk): The Amazon on-demand work platform.
-   Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS): The Microsoft on-demand work platform, can only be used by Microsoft staff and authorised third-parties.
