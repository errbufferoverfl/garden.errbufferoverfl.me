# Send me a note {{< fa feather-pointed >}}

Hey there!

Before you try to contact me, let's get a few things straight. If you’re here to ask me to be the next hire on your security engineering team or think, based on my website I'd make a great culture fit, let me stop you right there. The only "culture fits" I want to hear about are organizing fermented products in the cold store, and frankly I've got enough on my plate already.

You see, if the universe really wanted me to be that contactable, it would have equipped me with an SMTP server at birth. Instead, it gave me a a strong desire to become the creature that terrifies the townfolk and a cat named Lyla who demands most of my attention.

For everything else, go ahead and drop me a line. Just remember, I might take a while to respond – after all, I’m still waiting for my built-in email system upgrade.
