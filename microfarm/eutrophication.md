The process by which an entire body of water, or parts of it become enriched with minerals and nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus.

Eutrophication is a naturally occurring phenomenon, which is intensified by human activities such as clearing of land, application of fertilisers and dumping of industrial waste.

Eutrophication can cause:

- Algae blooms, which can make the environment toxic to native plants and animals. Algal toxins can make their way into humans when they are taken in by shellfish which are consequentially eaten;
- A decrease in biodiversity;
- New species invasion, for example in Europe and Asia Carp have adapted to live in eutrophic areas and have colonised their local water ways.

## Sad Eutrophic Facts

- 54% of lakes in Asian;
- 53% of lakes in Europe;
- 48% of lakes in North America;
- 41% of lakes in South America;
- 28% of lakes in Africa; and,
- more than 60% of reservoirs surveyed in South Africa are eutrophic.

There are at least 375 hypoxic coastal zones in the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly Japan.

## Eutrophication in Australia

The effects of eutrophication has been increasing since 1991 when more that 1,000kms of the Baaka/Barka – Darling River were affected by an algal bloom that killed hundreds of sheep and cattle, and caused human health impacts.[^1]

Since then there have been 4 similar algae blooms affecting the Murray in 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2016.

Between December 2018 and January 2019, 3 significant fish deaths occurred in the Baaka/Barka-Darling River, and algal blooms caused by eutrophication were identified as one of the major causes of the death of more than 1 million fish.

During the 2019-2020 bushfires more than 170,000 square kilometres burnt increasing the potential for algal blooms and hypoxic blackwater. Additionally, ash-enriched soil is highly erodible and can easily run into dams and rivers after a large rainfall event.

Between October 2019 and May 2020, more than 65 fish death events occurred across the Murray–Darling Basin as a result of run-off from bushfire-affected catchments.
