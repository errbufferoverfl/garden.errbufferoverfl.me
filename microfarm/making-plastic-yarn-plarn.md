## Step 1

Flatten the bad so the sides are folded out and the sides are straight forming a rectangle. Trim the bag, removing the top of the bag where the handles are, and the bottom above the seam.

## Step 2

Leave the bag in two layers, turn it so the closed ends are at the top and bottom and the open ends are to each side.

Cut the bag into 1-inch wide strips, working from the bottom fold to 1 inch short of the other fold. When the cutting is done, you'll have something that looks like a skirt with slits in it, but with the top edge closed.

## Step 3

Open up the bag to a single layer with the uncut section in front of you. You will be cutting from the end of one slit to the start of another, working diagonally across the uncut space.

Start by cutting across the space the lower first slit and the second top slit at an angle. Leave the top first slit for now. Continue cutting diagonally from lower slit to upper slit all the way across the bag. After the first few cuts, the strip will start to unwind and the process will become clearer!

## Step 4

At the beginning bag you will have an additional loop hanging off the strand where the first slit is. Cut it at an angle to open it up. Trim any odd extra bits of plastic off the plastic to smooth the edge.

If you accidentally cut the piece in two, just hang on to both pieces. They can be joined once you start crafting in the same way you join regular yarn together.
