## Canning

### Plain Pickled Carrots

#### Ingredients

- 1.24 kgs peeled carrots (about 1.5 kgs as purchased)
- 5½ cups white distilled vinegar (5%)
- 1 cup water
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 teaspoons canning salt
- 8 teaspoons mustard seed
- 4 teaspoons celery seed

**Yield:** About 4 pint jars

#### Method

- Wash and rinse canning jars; keep hot until ready to use. Prepare lids and bands according to manufacturer's directions.
- Wash and peel carrots well. Wash again after peeling and cut into rounds that are approximately ½-inch thick.
- Combine vinegar, water, sugar and canning salt in an 8 litre Dutch oven or stockpot. Bring to a boil and boil gently 3 minutes. Add carrots and bring back to a boil. Then reduce heat to a simmer and heat until the carrots are half-cooked (about 10 minutes).
- Meanwhile, place 2 teaspoons mustard seed and 1 teaspoon celery seed in the bottom of each clean, hot pint jar.
- Fill hot jars with the hot carrots, leaving 1-inch head-space. Cover with hot pickling liquid, leaving ½-inch head-space. Remove air bubbles and adjust head-space if needed. Wipe rims of jars with a dampened, clean paper towel; adjust two-piece metal canning lids.
- Process in a boiling water canner, as recommended in Table 1. Let cool, undisturbed, 12 to 24 hours and check for seals.

Allow carrots to sit in processed jars for 3 to 5 days before consuming for best flavour development.
