If you have a plastic worm farm you'll notice a catchment tray which allows excess moisture to seep out, this catches any condensation that develops during the breakdown of the scraps.

This water is often referred to as [leachate](leachate.md) which can contain anaerobic bacteria which thrives in wet, poorly drained soil that can produce toxic compounds that limit root growth and predispose plants to root diseases.

However,

Other sources have reported that worm water is suitable for watering plants with. [One source](https://gardenprofessors.com/whats-in-the-worm-juice/) reported that the leachate from their worm farm had the following properties:

| pH         | 8.5      |
|------------|----------|
| Nitrogen   | 1120 ppm |
| Phosphorus | 22 ppm   |
| Calcium    | 279 ppm  |
| Magnesium  | 211 ppm  |
| Sodium     | 634 ppm  |

They also reported trace amounts of Iron, Copper, Manganese, Zinc, Molybdenum, and Boron, all at levels less than 1 ppm.

But these macro and micro-nutrients will likely fluctuate between leachate batches depending on the contents of the worm farm.

While the jury seems to be out on whether worm water is good or bad for the garden there appear to be common rules while using it: 

- Ensure it is heavily diluted, most sources indicate a ratio of 1 part leachate to 10 parts water is good. 
- Use it on ornamental or decorative plants.
