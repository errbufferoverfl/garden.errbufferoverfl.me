Because there is some degree of ambiguity about what a [polyculture](polyculture.md) this can have a flow on effect to associated terms such as _intercropping_.

For example Gomez & Gomez 1983 defines intercropping as:

> The growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same field such that the period of overlap is long enough to include the vegetative stage.

And while this is technically accurate you'll probably find many want to take the definition one step further in specifying that when discussed in the context of polycultures it's more about creating mutual benefits between crops.

## Intercropping

A technique where two or more crops are grown in a space where they overlap with each other â€“ for example growing maize, beans and squash together, a combination often referred to as "the three sisters".

- The maize provides a structure for the beans to grown on;
- The beans provide nitrogen for all of the plants; and,
- The squash suppresses weeds on the ground.

Legumes are often intercropped because they fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil a process known as nitrogen fixation.
