## Canning

### Simple Canned Apples

### Ingredients

- 600ml of syrup of choice, per \~2 kilos of sliced apples.
- \[Optional\] Ascorbic acid.

**Yield:** 9kgs of apples will make about 7 pints.

#### Method

::: callout-tip
To prevent discolouration, slice apples into water containing ascorbic acid.
:::

- Wash, peel, and core apples.
- Place drained slices in a large saucepan and add \~600ml of syrup per \~2 kilos of sliced apples.
- Bring to the boil, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
- Fill sterile jars with hot slices and syrup. Leaving 1/2-inches head-space.
- Process in a boiling water canner, as recommended in Table 1. Or in a dial-gauge pressure canner, as recommended in Table 2. Let cool, undisturbed, 12 to 24 hours and check for seals.
