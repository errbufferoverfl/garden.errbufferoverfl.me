Case hardening occurs when produce is dehydrated at too high of a temperature, this causes the outside to become hard, making it difficult for the moisture inside to escape.

Case hardening occurs frequently in fruits and vegetables that are dried in their skin for example:

- grapes
- blueberries
- cranberries
- huckleberries
- lingonberries
- cherries
- peas
- corn

Case hardening can increase the likelihood of food spoilage.

Case hardening isn't quite the same issue as incomplete drying though. While they might look and read the same, the distinction lies in the root cause.

With incomplete drying, regular food just needs more time to dry out.

With case hardening, the outer skin causes the food to look and perhaps feel dry, but the reality is the moisture is **trapped** and more drying won't help.

## Causes & Contributions

Factors that contribute to case hardening include:

- Using a dehydrator that can only heat at one temperature.
- Fruit pieces are cut too large and the outer surface dries before the inside can release moisture.
- Not puncturing the skins of berries or peas to ensure moisture can escape during drying.
- Not blanching foods like corn or berries to break down the skin.

## Prevention

You can prevent case hardening by:

- Using a sufficiently low temperature for the produce you are dehydrating.
- Cut pieces into uniform, sufficiently thin slices.
- When drying whole-body berries or peas, break the skin during the pretreatment process.
- Pretreat the food, for example:
  - Pierce the skin with a sharp object (2-3 times can be helpful).
  - Blanching, for example for peas or cranberries with tougher skin to break the skin before drying.
  - Freeze fruit for 24 hours before drying to help break down the fruitâ€™s skin.
- Rotate the trays at least once when using a stackable machine. This prevents one tray staying too close to the heat source.
- Sense check the dehydrator temperature using an oven thermometer so you know that the reading is true to the dial.
