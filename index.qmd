## anarchist, illustrator, reluctant security engineer

Howdy! I'm errbufferoverfl. Welcome to my digital garden. I'm happy you're here. Please make yourself comfortable. By day, I'm the reluctant security engineer working on browser-based ecosystem security and OAuth stuff. By night I'm a gardener, knowledge librarian & artist. I currently live on the unceded land of the Boandik Peoples.

I'm passionate about social-anarchy, anti-capitalism & revolution; my main focuses are subsistence-farming, sustainable living, subverting surveillance capitalism, peer to peer technologies and anything I'm hyper fixated on at the time.

_Gardens_ while not originally named is my digital garden and personal assistant. It's an ever growing, changing, living document that functions as a repository for projects and a personal database for knowledge. It is a place where I collect words and thoughts as the years drift by. 

Welcome, I'm glad you're here, feel free to [poke around](/notebook).
