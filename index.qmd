## anarchist, illustrator, reluctant security engineer

I'm an anarchist, gardener, knowledge librarian & artist at heart, but security engineer by trade. I currently live on the unceded land of the [Wadawurrung and Dja Dja Wurrung People](/notebook/wadawurrung-and-dja-dja-wurrung-people.md).

I'm passionate about social-anarchy, anti-capitalism & revolution; my main focuses are subsistence-farming, sustainable living, subverting surveillance capitalism, peer to peer technologies and a host of other things.

My favourite RFC is [RFC 7282](/engineering/consensus-and-humming-in-the-ietf.md) üêù.

This is my digital garden a space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog where I cultivate my thoughts in public. Inside, you'll find very few polished articles, but lots of free form, work in progress notes.

A garden stands before you. Take a deep breath [and enter](/notebook/index.qmd).
