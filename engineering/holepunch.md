[Holepunch](https://github.com/holepunchto) is a company and suite of tools that "equips developers with a powerful suite of independent components to effortlessly construct peer-to-peer applications."

A Holepunch stack can be broken up into three parts:

## Building Blocks

- [Hypercore](hypercore.md)
- [Hyperbee](hyperbee.md)
- [Hyperdrive](hyperdrive.md)
- [Autobase](autobase.md)
- [HyperDHT](hyperdht.md)
- [Hyperswarm](hyperswarm.md)

keet.io is a peer to peer chat that is built entirely on Holepunch.

## Helpers
