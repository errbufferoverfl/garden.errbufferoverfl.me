Example: [NASA Lesson Number 5756](https://llis.nasa.gov/lesson/5756)

The ADLR framework is broken up into four parts:

- **Abstract:** a two or three sentence summary of what happened.

- **Driving Event:** a more detailed breakdown providing context on the events or circumstances surrounding the driving event occurred. Can include references, evidence, etc. but should remain blameless, stating objectively what happened.

- **Lesson(s) Learned:** focuses on what was learned as a consequence of the driving event.

- **Recommendation(s):** what changes can and should be made going forward to prevent the same event from occurring.

NASA also include a section on **evidence of recurrence control effectiveness**, which shows where the lesson has been referenced as part of other decisions or in the development of other practices.

While most people in an every day context won't be regularly writing up decisions or practices, including this section as a point of reflection is important.

Very often we make decisions about how to move forward after learning a lesson and forget to reflect on wether the recommendations actually serve us, or if they just made us feel like we improved something.
