## Attack Chain 1: Compromising Wordpress

### Detailed Summary

- Host enumeration and discovery
- Wordpress discovery and enumeration

### Technical Reproduction Steps

### Findings

#### Weak Password Requirements

*The affected host does not require users to have strong passwords, making it easier for threat actors to compromise user accounts.*

**CWE:** CWE-521
**CVSS 3.1 Score:** 9.4 Critical (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)
**Root Cause Analysis:** 
**Security Impact:** When successfully exploited, weak password requirements can result in a threat actor gaining long-term unauthorised access to the users account. Depending on the permissions associated with the compromised account, impact can vary.
**Affected Hosts:** blog.inlanefreight.local
**Remediation:**

#### Evidence

The following figure shows WPScan and the `rockyou.txt` password list against `blog.inlanefreight.local` to brute-force the password for the user account `doug`. `xmlrpc` is used as it is faster than HTTP-based password brute-forcing.

```
wpscan --url http://blog.inlanefreight.local --password-attack xmlrpc -t 20 -U doug -P ~/Sauce/SecLists/Passwords/rockyou.txt
