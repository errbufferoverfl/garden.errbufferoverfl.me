1/14 The ACCCE & police are currently running a fear campaign about end to end encryption centring their arguments this time on concerns about sextortion of teenagers. 🗞️[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-13/police-warn-of-sextortion-of-teens/102216558](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-13/police-warn-of-sextortion-of-teens/102216558)

2/14 But it’s clear this is the latest iteration of the crypto wars & the real goal is to subversively push an EARN IT-style act in Australia. The EARN IT Act it’s a guide of "best practices" that providers need to implement in order to "earn" immunity for hosting CSAM.

3/14 These "best practices" include refraining from using end-to-end encryption. The Internet Society & a host of others continue to work spreading awareness about the harms perpetuated by laws like this

4/14 But back to the OP – the platform the ACCCE & police are lobbying on looks to weaken end to end encryption "for the children" which is problematic for a few reason:

5/14 1️⃣ It weakens controls used by other vulnerable groups, like DV survivors who use end to end encryption as a confidential lifeline to get themselves & their families to safety.

6/14 2️⃣ Journalists rely on encryption when working on sensitive stories, especially in authoritarian countries.

7/14 3️⃣ Data confidentiality is crucial for businesses, & by weakening end to end encryption we inherently make it easier for threat actors to get access to our personal information.

8/14 In Australia the Telecommunications & Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance & Access) Act (TOLA), expanded the government’s powers to bypass digital data protections, which have been found to have negatively impact businesses & the economy.

9/14 The reality is keeping children safe online is more complicated than making the digital platforms they use responsible for the content they share, and we’re already seeing similar legislative changes happen overseas with harmful effects:

10/14 We know from research done in 2001, that most children targeted for sextortion are "at risk," with prior maltreatment or emotional/social difficulties. Most of these "at risk" children are at risk because they have had their trust, privacy & security abused by people in positions of authority.

11/14 What ACCCE & the Police are asking for is not the safety of children -- they are looking for an increased ability to surveil the Australian public.

12/14 Even the Australian Institute of Criminology found in their 2021 trends & issues report that there wasn’t enough evidence for policymakers & practitioners to make a reliable decision about criminal justice responses to CSAM offending

13/14 & without that, there is likely to be more harm done.

14/14 Ultimately if this was actually a matter of children's safety, we would be focusing our attention on children's liberation & giving them more self-determination, & better avenues to protect themselves from family & domestic violence.
