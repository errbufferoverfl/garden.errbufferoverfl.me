InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol, hypermedia and file sharing peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data to a distributed file system.

It is an alternative location-based hyper media server protocol that could replace HTTP/HTTPS. It allows users to host and receive content is a similar way to BitTorrent.

Any user in the network can serve a file by it's content address, and many other peers in the network can find and request content from any node who has it using a [DHT](dht.md).

IPFS seems to be strongly aligned to Web3, and is often mentioned in the same breath as cryptocurrency protocols. üö®

To develop IPFS, in 2017 Protocol Labs launched its own cryptocurrency named Filecoin.

Cloudflare started using IPFS in 2018 and launched its own gateway in 2022.

## How is it Being Used?

- Cryptocurrency
- Content Delivery
- Microsoft has built their [DID](did.md) on IPFS
- Discussion systems
- To prevent and/or circumvent censorship
  - [Distributed, privacy-enhancing technologies in the 2017 Catalan referendum on independence: New tactics and models of participatory democracy](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/9402/7692)
- Phishing
  - The phishing email is stored on Cloudflare's IPFS which displays the content as secure.
- Command and Control
  - The IPStore botnet uses IPFS to hide C2 traffic amongst the flow of legitimate data on the IPFS network.[^1] [^2]
