Decentralized identifier (DIDs) identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.

The [W3C DID Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did/) has developed and approved a [W3C Recommendations doc](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-imp-guide/).
