## Introduction to OWASP CLASP

The OWASP Comprehensive, Lightweight Application Security Process (CLASP) is an activity-driven, role-based set of processes which look to build security into an existing or new software development program in a structured, repeatable and, measurable way. It was once an important framework that provided organizations with immature security operations a structured view and clear use cases to address common vulnerabilities and improve application security practices. However, as the landscape of application security evolved, the need for a more comprehensive and adaptable framework became apparent.

In response to these changes, the OWASP community developed the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), which has since superseded CLASP. SAMM offers a more mature, flexible, and holistic approach to software security. It is designed to help organizations assess, formulate, and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to their specific risks, resources, and requirements.

While CLASP focused on specific security activities and roles within the development process, SAMM provides a broader, maturity-driven model that aligns with modern development practices and organizational structures. By adopting SAMM, organizations can ensure continuous improvement in their security posture, making it a more fitting successor to the foundational principles established by CLASP.

There are 5 CLASP views that provide different perspectives through which security activities can be understood and implemented:

- **Concepts View:** Provides an overview of the key security concepts and principles that underpin the CLASP framework. It serves as an educational resource to help team members understand the fundamental ideas behind secure software development.
- **Role-Based View:** Categorizes security activities based on the roles involved in the software development lifecycle. It provides a mapping of security tasks to specific roles such as developers, testers, project managers, etc.
- **Activity-Based View:** Focuses on specific security activities and tasks that need to be performed throughout the software development process. It organizes these activities into a structured format, making it easier to integrate them into existing development workflows.
- **Practices View:** This view outlines best practices and methodologies for implementing security within the software development lifecycle. It includes detailed recommendations for secure coding, testing, and deployment practices to ensure that security is an integral part of the development process.
- **Vulnerability View:** This view is centered around identifying and mitigating specific types of vulnerabilities. It provides guidance on how to address common security flaws and weaknesses in applications, helping to prioritize remediation efforts based on risk and impact.

## The CLASP Taxonomy

The CLASP taxonomy provides a detailed approach to understanding and mitigating security risks, ensuring that applications are developed with security in mind from the outset.

### Problem Types

The taxonomy begins by identifying the problem types that underlie security-related vulnerabilities. These problem types are the fundamental issues in software design, implementation, or configuration that can lead to security breaches. By categorizing vulnerabilities based on their root causes, the taxonomy helps developers and security professionals understand the specific nature of the threats they face. This understanding is crucial for diagnosing issues accurately and developing effective solutions.

### Categories

To help diagnostic and resolution processes, the identified problem types are divided into categories. These categories group similar types of vulnerabilities together, making it easier to address them systematically. For instance, categories might include input validation errors, authentication flaws, or configuration issues. By organizing problem types into categories, the taxonomy enables a more structured approach to vulnerability management, allowing for more targeted and efficient mitigation strategies.

### Exposure Periods

The taxonomy also considers the exposure periodsâ€”the phases of the SDLC during which vulnerabilities can be inadvertently introduced into application source code. These periods typically include requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. Understanding when vulnerabilities are most likely to be introduced helps teams focus their security efforts on the most critical stages of development, thereby reducing the likelihood of security issues making it into the final product.

### Consequences

An essential aspect of the taxonomy is understanding the consequences of exploited vulnerabilities for basic security services such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. By linking vulnerabilities to their potential impact on these core security principles, the taxonomy helps prioritize which vulnerabilities need immediate attention. This consequence-driven approach ensures that the most damaging vulnerabilities are addressed first, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the application.

### Platforms and Programming Languages

The taxonomy also takes into account the platforms and programming languages that may be affected by a vulnerability. Different platforms and languages have unique security characteristics and risks, and a vulnerability in one environment may not be relevant in another. By specifying the affected platforms and languages, the taxonomy provides more precise guidance for developers and security teams, enabling them to focus their efforts on relevant security measures.

### Resources Required for Attack

Another important component of the taxonomy is considering the resources required to exploit a vulnerability. This includes the skill level of the threat actor, the tools needed, and the time and effort required to execute an attack. Understanding the resources required for an attack helps in assessing the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and in designing appropriate defenses to deter potential threat actors.

### Risk Assessment

The taxonomy includes a framework for the risk assessment of exploitable/exploited vulnerabilities. This involves evaluating the severity and likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited, as well as their potential impact on the organization. Risk assessment helps prioritize vulnerabilities based on their threat level, ensuring that the most significant risks are addressed first.

### Avoidance and Mitigation Periods

Finally, the taxonomy outlines the avoidance and mitigation periods within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) when preventative measures and countermeasures can be applied. These periods are important for integrating security into the development process. By identifying when and how to implement security controls, the taxonomy helps ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed proactively, reducing the risk of security breaches in the deployed application.

## Roles and Responsibilities in CLASP

There are various roles to integrate security throughout the software development lifecycle. These roles are structured to ensure that security practices are embedded from the early stages of development and that every team member is aware of their specific security responsibilities.

1. **Project Manager:** Oversees the implementation of CLASP, ensuring that security requirements are defined and met throughout the project. They facilitate communication between different roles and ensure that security tasks are properly scheduled and executed.

2. **Security Auditor:** Conducts assessments and reviews to ensure that security practices are being followed. They audit code, configurations, and processes to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards.

3. **Developer:** Implements secure coding practices and integrates security features into the software. Developers are responsible for writing code that adheres to security guidelines and for addressing security issues identified by audits or testing.

4. **Architect:** Designs the system architecture with security in mind. They ensure that the overall design incorporates necessary security controls and mitigates potential threats. Architects play a crucial role in defining the security posture of the application.

5. **Tester:** Performs security testing to identify vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of security controls. Testers use various techniques, including penetration testing and code reviews, to ensure that the application is secure.

6. **Operations:** Manages the deployment and maintenance of the application, ensuring that security controls remain effective in the production environment. They handle incident response and implement operational security measures to protect the application.

7. **End User:** While not directly involved in development, end users are educated on secure usage practices and are encouraged to report any security issues they encounter.

## Vulnerability Management Using CLASP

The framework outlines a structured approach to cataloging vulnerabilities and understanding their root causes. This can help in systematically identifying, documenting, and mitigating security issues within software development.

### Cataloging Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability Identification:** CLASP provides guidelines for identifying vulnerabilities during different stages of the software development lifecycle. This involves regular code reviews, security testing, and threat modeling.

2. **Documentation:** Vulnerabilities are documented in detail, including their nature, potential impact, and mitigation strategies. This documentation is crucial for tracking and addressing security issues effectively.

3. **Classification:** Vulnerabilities are categorized based on their types, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), etc. This classification helps in understanding the common patterns and implementing relevant security controls.

4. **Use Cases:** Outline how specific vulnerabilities can be exploited and what the potential consequences are. This helps in educating developers and security teams about the real-world impact of these issues.

### Vulnerability Use Cases

These use cases are specific scenarios and examples that show how vulnerabilities can be identified, analyzed, and mitigated within the software development lifecycle. Thye help organizations understand common security issues and provide actionable steps to address them.

::: {.callout-warning}

The vulnerability use cases are based on common component architectures such as: monolithic UNIX, monolithic mainframe and distributed (HTTPS & TCP/IP) architectures so there *might* be gaps when used with modern software architecture.

### Root Causes

CLASP outlines several root causes for vulnerabilities, helping address the underlying issues rather than just the symptoms:

- **Lack of Security Awareness:** Insufficient training and awareness among developers and other team members about secure coding practices and emerging threats.

- **Inadequate Requirements Definition:** Failure to include security requirements during the initial phases of the project, leading to gaps that can be exploited later.

- **Design Flaws:** Architectural and design-level issues that introduce vulnerabilities. These might include improper trust boundaries, insecure communication channels, or flawed authentication mechanisms.

- **Implementation Errors:** Coding mistakes such as improper input validation, poor error handling, and inadequate access controls. These are often due to a lack of adherence to secure coding standards.

- **Insufficient Testing:** Inadequate security testing that fails to identify vulnerabilities before the software is deployed. This includes both automated and manual testing processes.

- **Configuration Issues:** Misconfigurations in software, hardware, or network settings that can lead to vulnerabilities. This includes default passwords, unnecessary services running, and incorrect permissions.

- **Third-Party Components:** Vulnerabilities introduced through the use of third-party libraries, frameworks, or services. These components may have their own security flaws that need to be managed.

- **Operational Weaknesses:** Weaknesses in the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance processes. This includes a lack of proper incident response plans and failure to update systems regularly.

### Vulnerability Root Causes & The Seven Pernicious Kingdoms

The OWASP CLASP framework identifies several root causes of vulnerabilities, which can be mapped to the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, a classification of software security vulnerabilities. The Seven Pernicious Kingdoms categorize software errors into broad types, which helps in understanding and addressing security issues more effectively.
