Gouache is a water based medium made of pigment, water and a binding agent, normally gum arabic or dextrin.

Gouache is similar to watercolour in that it can be re-hydrated and it infuses with the paper. While it also possesses qualities similar to that of acrylic and oil paint in that it's used for opaque painting styles.

Wet and dry gouache will have different values with lighter tones drying darker, and darker tones drying lighter, however, this is not a universal rule and it's important to swatch your colours before painting.
