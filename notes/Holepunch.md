[Holepunch](https://github.com/holepunchto) is a company and suite of tools that "equips developers with a powerful suite of independent components to effortlessly construct peer-to-peer applications."

A Holepunch stack can be broken up into three parts:

## Building Blocks

- [hypercore](notes/hypercore.md)
- [hyperbee](notes/hyperbee.md)
- [hyperdrive](notes/hyperdrive.md)
- [autobase](notes/autobase.md)
- [hyperdht](notes/hyperdht.md)
- [hyperswarm](notes/hyperswarm.md)

keet.io is a peer to peer chat that is built entirely on Holepunch.
