The topic of what makes an ethical hacker is always a tumultuous conversation within the security industry, over the years I've concluded that it's because of the way that the security industry coerces us to tie our every day roles as hackers, security engineers, red teamers and DFIR experts to our identity.

It's seen in training material where we're told that if we can't solve a problem we need to try harder. It's seen in bug bounty programs where security researcher is pitted against security researcher, and is perpetuated by our need to be chronically online, jacked in, turned up and fuzzed in.

But this isn't an essay about why our work will never love us. That's a conversation for another time. This is an essay about why ethical hacking will always be antithetical to ethical hacking as long as it positions itself inline with authority. But more broadly, this is an essay about why the **security industry** will always be antithesis to a XXX describe the world here in a way here.

This essay has been in the ideation phase for years, stewing in my brain, with new ingredients added every time there is discussion of new online safety bills, increases to government surveillance powers, further commodification of personal data, and rollbacks in human rights.

More recently though I was prompted to start writing this out, at least drafting it after seeing a tweet that basically described ethical hackers as the pick me of the security industry.

For those unfamiliar with the discussion about what ethical hacking is, I think it's important to note that there is no industry agreed upon term, and while there is a Ethical Hacking Certification and a body that "governs" who is and isn't an "ethical hacker" this is for most part a cash grab.

Needless to say, the term most commonly cited for better or worse is
> a person who hacks into a computer network in order to test or evaluate its security, rather than with malicious or criminal intent.
