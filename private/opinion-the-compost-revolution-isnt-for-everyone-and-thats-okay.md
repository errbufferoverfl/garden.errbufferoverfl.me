Composting is a broad term because it can mean a lot of different things, in most cases it's an umbrella term covering a variety of methods that cover converting organic matter into a decayed form that is more appropriate for growing plants, this can mean "traditional" composting done in a plastic, metal or wooden bin. Vermicomposting the product of earthworm digestion and aerobic decomposition using the activities of micro- and macroorganisms at room temperature. Or Bokashi composting, a fermentation process also referred to as "pre-composting".

In this article, I'm mainly referring to traditional composting done in a plastic, metal or wooden bin but I think a lot of my comments could easily apply to vermicomposting. But enough about what composting *is*… 

As we spiral faster and fasting into a climate crisis because of government inaction, I've noticed more and more friends and family have been turning to building more sustainable habits, composting in particular has been a big one.

The Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water report that each year we waste around 7.68 million tonnes of food across the **supply** and **consumption** chain.

When we break this down, just the **household consumer** chain contributes 2.46 million tonnes. 1.79 million tonnes of which ends up in landfill. Based on the data collected in the 2021 National Food Waste Baseline report, household consumers are actually the biggest producer of food waste, and we over represent for landfill destination.

But that's ultimately not saying much because primary industry, manufacturing, distribution and other consumer branches like hospitality often have better subsidies and access to better alternatives like commercial composting or on-farm disposal.

You'll even notice in the "the first steps on our collective journey"  the government is making an initial commitment of about $1.3 million over 24 months to support, amongst other things "a voluntary commitment program that will initially engage businesses and industries to commit to actions that reduce food waste"…

And while I don't want to get to far into critiquing the governments *National Food Waste Strategy*, and it's focus on meeting obligations to the United Nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (rather than being more proactive), and reducing unnecessary food waste to improve our food sovereignty it does seem to be very lacking in proactive support of individuals.

But I digress, I think initiatives like [Compost Revolution](https://compostrevolution.com.au/) which help people locate council subsidies for composting and composting adjacent resources that ultimately help reduce the amount of household waste that goes directly to landfill. 

But I think one conversation that a lot of people, especially those wanting to do good are avoiding, which brings me to the crux of this post:

> Maintaining a compost bin is work, and that work isn't for everyone – and that's okay.
