For a variety of reasons, some more valid than others, there are certain genus of plants that are classified as weeds, or invasive species. However, these can be overloaded terms, that doesn't always translate well between movements.

And the classification of what is and isn't a weed doesn't always mesh with other requirements of a system. For example, **ragwort**, classified as a noxious weed in the Republic of Ireland is also an excellent source of nectar for pollinators.

Another example, is Kudzu, while considered a noxious weed in in five United States states: Florida, Kansas, Oregon, Pennsylvania and West Virginia[^1] it is also a nitrogen fixer, animal feed and for weaving.

To create a positive relationship with the ecosystem, we must remove the concept of morality from these plants, because they aren't actually good or bad. They are plants that over centuries of evolution have evolved to be opportunistic â€” thriving in the edges, and in places we have interfered.

Naturally, you might think the alternative then is to do nothing about it, which is far from the case. Rather it requires balance and instead focus on optimising the edges (see [[notes/permaculture#Principals|Permaculture]]).
