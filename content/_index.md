Howdy! 👋🏻

I'm **[[the-notebook/errbufferoverfl|errbufferoverfl]]**, and this is my digital garden! 🌱

I'm an anarchist, gardener, knowledge librarian & artist at heart, but security engineer by trade. I currently live on the unceded land of the [[the-notebook/wadawurrung-and-dja-dja-wurrung-people|Wadawurrung and Dja Dja Wurrung People]].

I'm constantly learning to be a better social-anarchist, anti-capitalist & revolutionary; my main focuses are subsistence-farming, sustainable living, subverting surveillance capitalism, peer to peer technologies and a host of other things.

My favourite RFC is [[the-notebook/consensus-and-humming-in-the-ietf|RFC 7282]] 🐝
