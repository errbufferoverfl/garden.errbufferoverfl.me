Welcome Internet traveller! Welcome to my digital garden.

I'm **[[notes/errbufferoverfl|errbufferoverfl]]**, or Buffy for short. I'm a non-binary (**they/sie/ze**) anarchic gardener, knowledge librarian, and [[notes/security engineer|security engineer]] by trade.

I work at Canva as an Application Security engineer, focusing on building out a Partnerships function and helping to build a secure app ecosystem. I currently live on the unceded land of the [[notes/Wadawurrung and Dja Dja Wurrung People|Wadawurrung and Dja Dja Wurrung People]], and can often be found:

- 🖋️ drawing or printing anarchic and technology themed badges, prints and designs on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/errbufferoverfl).
- 💾 creating patchwork quilts of code snippets and infrastructure, deep-diving technological standards and exploring all the ways teaching sand to think was a mistake.
- 🗞️ curating the ✨vibes✨ and compiling zines that magnify marginalized voices in information security, providing a space for people to publish pieces that are messy, unpolished or don't have any expressed value under capitalism.
