Welcome to my digital garden. 🌱

I'm **[[notes/errbufferoverfl|errbufferoverfl]]**, or Buffy for short. I'm a non-binary (**they/sie/ze**) anarchic gardener, knowledge librarian, and [[notes/security-engineer|security-engineer]] by trade.

I currently live on the unceded land of the [[notes/wadawurrung-and-dja-dja-wurrung-people|wadawurrung-and-dja-dja-wurrung-people]].
