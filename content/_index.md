Welcome to my digital garden. 🌱

I'm **[errbufferoverfl](notes/errbufferoverfl.md)**, or Buffy for short. I'm a non-binary (**they/sie/ze**) anarchist, gardener, knowledge librarian, and security engineer by trade.

I currently live on the unceded land of the [Wadawurrung and Dja Dja Wurrung People](notes/wadawurrung-and-dja-dja-wurrung-people.md).
