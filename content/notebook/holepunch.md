[Holepunch](https://github.com/holepunchto) is a company and suite of tools that "equips developers with a powerful suite of independent components to effortlessly construct peer-to-peer applications."

A Holepunch stack can be broken up into three parts:

## Building Blocks

- [[hypercore|Hypercore]]
- [[hyperbee|Hyperbee]]
- [[hyperdrive|Hyperdrive]]
- [[autobase|Autobase]]
- [[hyperdht|HyperDHT]]
- [[hyperswarm|Hyperswarm]]

keet.io is a peer to peer chat that is built entirely on Holepunch.
