Permaculture is a set of principals and practices to design **sustainable human settlements**. Permaculture cannot solve the problems of an unsustainable human settlement or society.

Permaculture is system thinking applied to ecology and focuses on the interconnectedness of nature. There is a focus on:
- Caring for Earth;
- Caring for people; and,
- Reinvesting the surplus created.

A garden designed with ecological principals should: 
- Be inviting to animals and people;
- Require infrequent watering and labor;
- Provide soil that regenerates itself.

## Principals

1. Observe the system through the seasons and design with these changes in mind.
2. Connect elements in ways that create connectedness, these connection will help you save time.
3. Catch and store energy.
4. Pick elements and place them so they are most utilised — stack elements not only in time, but also in space.
5. Build redundancy in, ensure each function us supported by multiple elements.
6. Identify leverage points in the system, this way small changes have a big impact.
7. Build small intensive system and grow them by chunking.
8. Optimise the edges, where two systems meet is where there is most diversity, increase or decrease edges as needed.
9. Collaborate with succession, don't fight a maturing system — they are more stable and productive.
10. Use biological and renewable resources where possible as they reproduce and build up over time.
