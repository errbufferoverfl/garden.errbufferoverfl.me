A polyculture is the practice of growing more than one crop or species in the same space at the same time.

A paper written by Larry Geno and Dr Barbara Geno "*[Polyculture Production Principles, Benefits and Risks of Multiple Cropping Land Management Systems for Australia](https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/publications/01-034.pdf)*" notes that:

> the polyculture practices evolved to fit an almost infinite number of geographical and climatic niches and a wide range of human needs.

So while many resources will often talk about the aim of a polyculture being "to mimic the diversity of a natural ecosystem" that's not the whole picture because there are various forms of polycultures that don't mimic the diversity of a natural ecosystem and instead resemble complicated companion planting schemes.

[[source](http://www.hort.cornell.edu/brewer/polycultures/Polyculture%20Design%20slides.pdf)]

The definition that has most resinated with me though is from these [Polyculture Design slides](http://www.hort.cornell.edu/brewer/polycultures/Polyculture%20Design%20slides.pdf):

> A community of multifunctional plants, animals, and fungi that is designed for functional interconnection.

The reason being is that multifunctional can be described in many ways, some examples from the slide deck include:
- **Humans Needs**
	- Food
	- Fuel
	- Fodder
	- Medicine
	- Aesthetics
- **Ecosystem Services**
	- Nitrogen Fixation
	- Nutrient Accumulations/Fertility
	- Living Mulch/Ground Cover
	- Insectary
	- Nectary/Pollen

One of the things that is interesting to note, is that by "typical" definitions people often reference the fact that polycultures can reduce crop yields because all the different species are competing for light, water and nutrients.

But I'd argue that in a well planned polyculture this isn't actually the case, or it's less often the case — and when it is the case, I wonder if our valuation of polycultures output is tainted by excess accumulation, i.e., I didn't get what *I* thought *I* deserved out of this system.

Another point often discussed that I question is wether growing multiple cultivars in a well planned polyculture does in fact complicate care — given the example:

Yarrow → attracts → Lacewing → protects → Brassicas

Is the care complicated or simplified?

A notable example of a polyculture and perhaps the best demonstration of "true" [[intercropping|intercropping]] is "the three sisters", which sees maize, beans and squash planted together:
- The maize provides a structure for the beans to grown on;
- The beans provide nitrogen for all of the plants; and,
- The squash suppresses weeds on the ground.

I've found better examples of "good" polycultures when discussing integrated aquaculture where seafood and plants are grown together.
