Fedges should be planted with a variety of different plants to support biodiversity.

For example, to provide food a bulk of the hedge can be planted with creeping plants like:

To add nitrogen to the soil: 
	- Clover → Running Postman (*Kennedia prostrata*);
	- Shrubs → Native Wisteria (*Hardenbergia comptoniana*) & Coral Creeper (*K. Coccinea*);
	- Siberian Pea Shrubs → Pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*);
	- Buffalo Berries → Lilly Pilly (*Syzygium smithii*).

While deep rooted plants like:
- Chicory;
- Yarrow; or,
- Daikon.

Will pull nutrients from the subsoil and deposit them as leaf litter.

Finally, mulch producing species like:
- Comfrey;
- Cardoon; and,
- Thick-leaved artichoke.

Can be used to create a mulch layer retaining water.
