The "state" is a centralised political organisation that imposes and enforces rules over a population within a territory.

> Definitions of state are disputed and can vary depending on context and audience.

Walter Scheidel an Austrian historian maintains that most modern definitions of the state have the following in common:
- Centralised institutions that impose rules;
- Back these rules up by force;
- Within a territorially circumscribed population; 
- With a distinction between the rulers and the ruled; 
- Includes an element of autonomy, stability, and differentiation.
