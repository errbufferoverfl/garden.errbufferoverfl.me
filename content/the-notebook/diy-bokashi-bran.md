## What You Need to Make Bokashi Bran

- **A simple carbohydrate** — any simple carbohydrate source will work, most recipes call for molasses, but some folks report being able to use sugar or syrup.
- **Water** — Bokashi microbes use water to move around, eat and multiple, some recipes call for de-chlorinated water, I forgot to do this and just used normal tap water.
- **Bran** — you can use almost any porous/absorptive carbohydrate instead of bran, which simply provides a home for the bacteria to cover and live on.
	- Future plans to try: rice husks, newspaper, shredded cardboard, coffee grounds…
- **Essential Microbes (EM-1)** — Essential Microbes are the key to Bokashi working, you can make your own, or buy them online [[source](https://www.oneorganic.com.au/product/em-effective-microorganisms/)].

**The basic ratio is: 1 tbsp EM-1, 1 tbsp food source, 2 cups water, 900g flake material.**

### Ingredients

- 2 ½ tbsp EM-1
- 2 ½ tbsp blackstrap molasses
- 4 ½ cups water
- 2kgs wheat bran

### Method

1. Mix your sugary food source into lukewarm water.
2. Add EM-1 to your water/sugar mixture.
3. Dump your bran/flake material into your mixing bucket.
4. Add 3/4 of the water to the mixing bucket.
5. Keep adding water until you reach the desired consistency. — You want it to be thoroughly moist and stick together when you squeeze it into a ball. If water drips out, it is too moist. If you overshoot, you can add a bit more bran to bring it back into balance.
6. Place the mixture into your airtight container.
7. Place the container in a cool dark place for two weeks. **Do not open the container!** The microbes should remain undisturbed to proliferate, they will spend the two weeks fermenting the flakes until it is fully inoculated.
8. Open the container and use your finished bokashi bran! When you open the container your bran should have a sweet fermented smell that some people compare to apple cider or activated yeast.

### Shelf-Life

If your bokashi bran is wet it should be re-dried or used within 2 weeks to avoid spoilage.
