The following examples were collated from online searches of intercropping online, and many were rightly or wrongly compiled on the foundation of companion planting.

Ultimately the biggest issue I see with a lot of these examples is they put more focus on human needs rather than system needs. 

Like sure Yarrow *does* promote insectary but the planting of Yarrow is **primarily** for the purpose of protecting the Brassica.
