A term coined by US-Republican president Herbert Hoover, it's a term that indicates that an individual is self-reliant and independent from outside, usually state assistance.

> We were challenged with a... choice between the American system of rugged individualism and a European philosophy of diametrically opposed doctrines ­ doctrines of paternalism and state socialism. The acceptance of these ideas would have meant the destruction of self-government through centralization... [and] the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grown to unparalleled greatness.
> 
> — Herbert Hoover, 1928

Through the mid-twentieth century Ray Lyman Wilbur, an American politician, physician, and *eugenicist* doubled down on this idea, writing:

> It is common talk that every individual is entitled to economic security. The only animals and birds I know that have economic security are those that have been domesticated—and the economic security they have is controlled by the barbed-wire fence, the butcher's knife and the desire of others. They are milked, skinned, egged or eaten up by their protectors.

Irrespective of continued proof that social spending and the [[welfare state]] can have a positive benefit on society as a whole a 2016 poll by Pew Research found:
- 57% of Americans did not believe that success in life was determined by forces outside of their control.
- 58% of Americans valued a non-interventionist government over one that actively worked to further the needs of society.
