> The artwork in the dossier is by [Birender Kumar Yadav](https://www.instagram.com/birender__yadav/), a multi-disciplinary Indian artist from Dhanbad, a city of iron ore and coal built on the backs of mineworkers and indigenous people. Much of Yadavâ€™s work, informed by his early experiences as the son of a blacksmith who worked in a coal mine, draws attention to the issues of class hierarchies and the plight of the working class.
