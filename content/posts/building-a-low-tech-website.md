As discourse around the impacts of Artificial intelligence (Ai) swirls in the background, one of the things I've been thinking about a lot is this idea we have that someday Ai will automate the boring things so everyone can focus on endeavours that are more fulfilling.

It reads like an anti-work dream! 

But the reality that I've been seeing is that businesses are using Ai to undercut human employees in various ways[^1] [^2] [^3]. 

In many tech fields this looks like augmenting development workflows with Ai to speed up the development and deployment of new features to bring in more monthly active users (MAUs).

MAUs a user engagement metric that tracks the number of unique visitors that engage with a site, platform, or app within a specified month. It's considered one of the most significant metric for modern technology companies and is used heavily to determine the value of a company, and therefore influence how much a business is worth.



But in turn, more customers means more infrastructure, more infrastructure means more energy used and consumed. And while sustainable software engineering has become a hot-button topic[^5] when it comes to strategic technology trends 







As many artists and creatives have pointed out though, corporations have created a world where Ai is being used to generate art – almost like it's to prevent us from deriving any amount of joy from existing in this hellscape.



Recently inspired by [[Permacomputing]] and the work done by the folks behind *[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/team/)* I decided it was high-time to improve

## Carbon Emissions

Wholegrain Digital have developed a carbon calculator that can be used to calculate the energy and emission of a web page.

To [calculate the energy and emission of a web page](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/) Wholegrain Digital use the following data points:

1. Data transfer over the wire
2. Energy intensity of web data
3. Energy source used by the data centre
4. Carbon intensity of electricity
5. Website traffic

Using [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/garden-errbufferoverfl-me/) it originally calculated the CO2 produced by
