Recently inspired by [[Permacomputing]] and the work done by the folks behind *[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/team/)* I decided it was high-time to improve

## Carbon Emissions

Wholegrain Digital have developed a carbon calculator that can be used to calculate the energy and emission of a web page.

To [calculate the energy and emission of a web page](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/) Wholegrain Digital use the following data points:

1. Data transfer over the wire
2. Energy intensity of web data
3. Energy source used by the data centre
4. Carbon intensity of electricity
5. Website traffic

Using [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/garden-errbufferoverfl-me/) it originally calculated the CO2 produced by
