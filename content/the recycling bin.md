I'm a chronic project starter and a infrequent project finisher -- but I also think that finishing projects is overrated.

I think we often put to much emphasis on closing things out rather than taking what we need or wrapping up when they stop bringing us joy -- maybe this is a symptom of being dopamine-driven or my antithesis to success-culture.

This document serves as a reminder to myself, and a testament to others you don't need to finish or be successful in the traditional sense to be proud of what you've accomplished.

### Kult of the Cyber Witch

> Kult of the Cyber Witch was a holistic information security and culture zine that centered on people of marginalised genders and sexes experiences within the Oceania region.

Finding people to submit for this was so difficult, in retrospect I think providing themes and making the submission criteria clearer would have absolutely helped. I also didn't have a lot of hands on help for editing, operations and design so it only compounded the issue of trying to publish a zine anthology.

### USB Canary

> A Linux or OSX tool that uses psutil to monitor devices while your computer is locked. In the case it detects someone plugging in or unplugging devices it can be configured to send you an SMS or alert you via Slack or Pushover.

This was a tool that I wrote in response to common occurrence of hacker **friends** messing with computers while the owner was away. At the time there weren't many open-source options available as most people used bash scripts that showed an alert rather than hooked into external notification systems.

It was also one of the first thing I had written that had received any significant amount of traffic, so when I got an influx of feedback about its relevance for real-world use and a handful of pointed issues it felt like I didn't have a place in the world of security open source and I archived the project.
