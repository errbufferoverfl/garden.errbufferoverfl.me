The concept of a 100 days project is you commit to doing something consistently for 100 days straight. For a non sequential 100 days I created a [[../notebook/gouache|gouache]] painting using [100 Days of Drawing](https://www.booktopia.com.au/100-days-of-drawing-guided-sketchbook--jennifer-lewis/book/9781419732171.html) by Jennifer Lewis.
