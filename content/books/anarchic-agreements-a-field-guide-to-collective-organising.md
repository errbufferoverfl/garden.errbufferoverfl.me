A new world is possible and not just in our hearts. Anarchic Agreements is a quintessential field guide for the revolution, answering the practical questions often left out of works of political theory and philosophy. How do leaderless groups organize? How might they create constitutions, balance power and write protocols? How do group cultures and institutions maintain coalitions? This urgent and inspiring how-to is the product of more than twenty years of research. Designed explicitly for everyday use, it contains lived examples, illustrations throughout, and text from current horizontally organized constitutions. These documents illustrate the never-ending process of developing community and keeping collaborations alive in the fairest ways possible. Written by dedicated anarchist scholars and organizers, and based on the widely popular Anarchic Agreements pamphlet series, this book facilitates grassroots activism and provides methods to improve and streamline decision making. It is an inspiring celebration of the novel, complex and flexible constitutions Anarchists have created over time. This book shows how to realize another world, collectively without domination, while leaving the future open to infinite other possibilities.

## High-Level Thoughts

Good book to read cover to cover, but ultimately better as a reference, this book is a practical guide to building durable, fair and coercion free groups and coalitions. It won't tell you how-to in the traditional sense but provides the tools needed to determine how to.

## Summary Notes

Constitutions aren't static documents (nor do they need to be written documents!), they are (or should be) constantly revised. They define "rules" (social norms?) of a community and divide power into visible sub-groups so that it's not all concentrated within one group of people, i.e., cliques, or friendship groups.

Supporting the process of constitutionalising doesn't imply that [anarchists](anarchist) need to support or defend the constitution of state and nation. But we should acknowledge that a constitution in a group or coalition can be helpful in defining our understanding of right and wrong, and balancing power.

The difference with constitutions backed by [the state](notes/the-state.md) is not only are they remain fixed and difficult to change even when our ideas of equality, equity and material power change. This is compounded by the fact the state often uses coercive controls to keep people from contesting or challenging the existing constitution.

Modern constitutions represent the interests of the most powerful individuals and groups in society and changing these constitutions means changing the interests of the most powerful â€“ which is unlikely to happen especially if as part of redefining the constitution their power and privilege is reduced, redistributed or removed.

Therefore it's important to keep in mind, having a constitution, or a constitutional process is not the same as democracy, and democracy isn't always antithetical to the constitution of a society.

### Building Durable Groups

A constitution, wether written or not should aim to create a shared understanding of who the group is, and how they do things. (Similar to a team working agreement?). A good anarchic constitution must be: **consensual**, **changeable**, and **conscious**.

Consensual doesn't mean being told what to do, to have a proper consensual agreement, everyone should be able to shape the agreement, or at the least have their needs taken into account. 

Because protracted meetings about policies can lead to a group losing people who are keen to get things done, it's important to find compromise
