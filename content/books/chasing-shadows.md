From Irish revolutionaries to the Christchurch massacre and the rise of right wing extremism, Chasing Shadows uncovers the long and brutal history of terrorism in Australia. Australia likes to assume that extremists and their dark ideas can be stopped at the border. But Fortress Australia, and the sense of security it provides, is an illusion. For over a century, extreme ideologies have seeped through the borders into Australian communities. Terrorists have repeatedly emerged from the shadows, bringing terrible violence. Chasing Shadows exposes the surprisingly long history of political and religious violence in Australia. It includes previously classified and little-known information, shedding new light on major incidents and thwarted plots. It discloses secret training camps, hit lists and forgotten missions. It reveals the true nature and extent of terrorism in Australia. This history spans Irish nationalists, justice commandos and left-wing radicals who sought to foment revolution. It explores the religious cults of Ananda Marga and Aum Shinrikyo, and the jihadist networks of Al-Qaeda and Islamic State. It also traverses right-wing extremism, from Croatian fascists through to the white supremacists who have dominated headlines since the Christchurch massacre. 'Essential reading for those seeking to understand the contemporary terrorist phenomenon in Australia.' - David Irvine AO, former Director-General of Security in charge of ASIO 'We can only defeat terrorism if we understand it first . . . A compelling read for anyone who wants to understand how we have arrived where we are.' - Andrew Colvin APM, OAM, former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police 'Engaging, well-researched and comprehensive, Chasing Shadows is a major contribution to understanding the past and present terrorist threats to Australia.' - Emeritus Professor David Horner AM FASSA, author of The Spy Catchers 'Dr Campion's work should be read by all who want to understand the long and painful history of terrorism in Australia.' - Professor Randall Law, Birmingham-Southern College, USA
