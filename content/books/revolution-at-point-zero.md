*Written between 1974 and 2016, Revolution at Point Zero collects four decades of research and theorising on the nature of housework, social reproduction, and women’s struggles on this terrain—to escape it, to better its conditions, to reconstruct it in ways that provide an alternative to capitalist relations. Indeed, as Federici reveals, behind the capitalist organisation of work and the contradictions inherent in “alienated labor” is an explosive ground zero for revolutionary practice upon which are decided the daily realities of our collective reproduction.* 

*Beginning with Federici’s organisational work in the Wages for Housework movement, the essays collected here unravel the power and politics of wide but related issues including the international restructuring of [[posts/reproductive-labor|reproductive work]] and its effects on the sexual division of labor, the globalisation of care work and sex work, the crisis of elder care, the development of affective labor, and the politics of the commons. This revised and expanded edition includes three additional essays and a new preface by the author.*

**authored by** [[Silvia Federici]]

### War, Globalisation and Reproduction (2000)

> First came the foreign bankers eager to lend at extortionate rates; then the financial controllers to see that the interest was paid; then the thousands of foreign advisors taking their cut. Finally, when the country was bankrupt and helpless, it was time for the foreign troops to “rescue” the ruler from his “rebellious” people. One last gulp and the country had gone.
> – Thomas Pakenham, _The Scramble for Africa_

Developed world initiatives are largely based on globalisation and pushing imperialism, but it takes the form of food aid and humanitarianism. These are just tactics to gain and maintain control over other states.

Comes in the form of structural adjustment programs (SAPs), introduced in the 19080s by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Americanisation of the world, and pushing "neoliberal" ideals and policy, including land privatisation, abolition of communal land tenure, downsizing the public sector and defunding social services, all these activities shift systems of controls from African governments to the World Bank and NGOs.

 These "programs" were supposed to improve the state of the economy, but more than a decade on the opposite has happened, local economies have collapsed, foreign investment hasn't materialised. 
 
War forces people off the land, it takes producers away from the means of production. Then when the land is no longer being used, the land is reclaimed in the name of capitalists, boosting the production of [cash crops](notes/cash-crops.md) and export oriented agriculture.

Controlling food and food based aid is able to do what arming militia can't. Often delivered to both sides it can be delivered by organisations other than the Red Cross which allows them to intervene in areas of conflict. This was used to justify the US/UN military intervention in Somalia in 1992/3.

Even if troops aren't involved in the distribution or guarding of food, the delivery of food is always intervention that prolongs war by feeding contending armies (more often then civilians). This in turn shapes military strategy and most benefits those who can take advantage of food distribution.

Because of the control food aid gives to imperial forces, shaping warfare
