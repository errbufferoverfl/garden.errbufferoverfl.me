## Before You begin…

The notes and summaries included in these pages are snippets that remind me, or help me relate and explore high-level concepts. They aren't a summary of the chapter or book! If you look through these notes and like the ideas, disagree with them, or you find yourself synthesising new ideas, I recommend you read the whole book!
