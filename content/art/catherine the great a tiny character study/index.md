I've been sick these past few days, so I've been watching a lot of "The Great" a quasi-historical comedy-drama based on the rise to power of Catherine the Great, Empress of All Russia. 

I'm absolutely in love with all the characters and their performance, especially Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult so I drew up a little study of Catherine storming around the Winter Palace.
