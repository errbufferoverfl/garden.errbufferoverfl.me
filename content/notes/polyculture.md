A polyculture is the practice of growing more than one crop or species in the same space at the same time.

The aim of a polyculture is to mimic the diversity of a natural ecosystem, in some cases this can provide pest, weed and disease control.

Polycultures can reduce crop yields because all the different species are competing for light, water and nutrients.

When growing multiple cultivars a polyculture can complicate care if they have different growth rates, days to maturity and harvest requirements.

The most notable example of a polyculture is the intercropping of maize, beans and squash often referred to as "the three sisters".
- The maize provides a structure for the beans to grown on;
- The beans provide nitrogen for all of the plants; and,
- The squash suppresses weeds on the ground.

Another example of a polyculture is found in integrated aquaculture where seafood and plants are grown together.

While using a polyculture model requires less human intervention, the development of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers, monocultures became the primary agriculture model.
