The principles of **embodiment** look at diverse experiences and relationships as human beings embodying multiple identities and realities in “disembodied” online spaces.

## Consent

Women's agency lies in their ability to make informed decisions on what aspects of our lives we share online.

If social media wanted to they could embed consent into their product, but they don't and instead focus on extracting as much data as possible with little attention to who is posting data to whom.

In the *general* (read: Newscorp & Murdoch) media, we see a lack of outrage about a lack of transparency in privacy breaches.

This is also a core theme of [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](books/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism.md) and is core to maintaining [surveillance capitalism](notes/surveillance-capitalism.md).

### Principle in Action

- [Terms of Service Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org/) provides a mechanism in which users can provide informed consent when using a website because they can understand **what** they are agreeing to.

## Privacy & Data

Everyone should have the right to privacy and to full control over personal data and information online at all levels. There is a staunch rejection of private and state data collection for profit and online user manipulation.

Surveillance is a patriarchal tool, used to control and restrict women's bodies, speech and activism. This type of control doesn't start at home, or end with the state and we must pay equal attention to the surveillance practices of individuals, the private sector, [the-state](notes/the-state.md)] and non-state actors.
