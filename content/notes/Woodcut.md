A technique originally developed in China as a way of printing on textiles and later on paper, the oldest surviving fragments to survive date back to the Han dynasty (before 220).

Woodcut is a type of relief printing where an artist carves an image into the surface of a block of wood. When printing, areas that are cut away carry no ink while characters or images at surface level carry the ink to produce the print.

Linocut is a variation of woodcutting where Linoleum is used instead of wood, making the art style more accessible to a professional and non-professional artists.
