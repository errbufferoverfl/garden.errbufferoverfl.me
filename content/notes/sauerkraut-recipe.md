> [!note] Making brine
> 
> Heaps of recipes will say "you're not supposed to use brine, just use the water that comes out of the vegetables!" and honestly, I've never made a batch that produces enough water that I don't need additional brine. So in this house we use brine.

## Method

- Cut and shred the vegetables. Save a few cabbage leaves for the top.
- Put it into a clean fermenting vessel.
- Add in the spice mix and give everything a mix so the spice is well distributed.
- Push everything down with a potato masher or something. Clean hands also work. ðŸ¤·
- Make brine using the ratio provided for a 2% mix, let cool.
- Pour the brine in and give everything another little push down, make sure there is enough brine to cover the vegetables.
- Cover with the cabbage leaves. 
- Put either some fermenting stones, or a clean rock on top to weight everything down.
- Close the vessel and store in a dark corner for a few weeks depending on temperature.

> [!info] Temperatures for fermenting
> 
> Warmer temperatures will speed up fermentation, cooler temperatures will slow down fermentation, so:
> - At 21Â°â€“23Â°C sauerkraut will be done in 3-4 weeks.
> - At 15Â°â€“18Â°C sauerkraut will be done in about 6 weeks.
