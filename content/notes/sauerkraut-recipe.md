Sauerkraut recipe for Week 26, 2023. 

## Ingredients

- 2453g cabbage
- 674g carrot
- 252g apple
- 450g celeriac (forgot to weigh it, so this is a guess)
- 1 packet of [sauerkraut seasoning](https://herbsandspicesaustralia.com/product/pickling-spice-mix-for-cabbage/)
- 0.02g salt per kilo of vegetables + water
	- (3000ml water + 3829g vegetables) x 0.02g = 136.58g pickling salt

> [!note] Making brine
> 
> Heaps of recipes will say "you're not supposed to use brine, just use the water that comes out of the vegetables!" and honestly, I've never made a batch that produces enough water that I don't need additional brine. So in this house we use brine.

## Method

- Weight your fermentation vessel, and write the weight down.
- Cut and shred the vegetables, weight them and write this number down. Make save to save a few cabbage leaves for the top.
- Put all your vegetables into your clean fermenting vessel.
- Add in the spice mix and give everything a mix so the spice is well distributed.
- Add enough water to cover the vegetables.

> [!note] Pre-boiling water
> 
> It's probably not required in places that have good quality soft water, like Victoria, but I always boil and cool the water as an extra step.

- Give everything another weigh and subtract the vegetables and fermentation vessel from the number on the scale. This is how the water weighs. Add this number to the weight of the vegetables.

> [!note] Weight of water
> 
> If you're like me you can just measure the amount of liquid you added in ml/liters and assume 1L = 1000g ðŸ¤·

- Make brine using the ratio provided for a 2% mix, if you want a different ratio, I like to use this [brine calculator](https://hakkobako.com/fermentation-brine-calculator/).
- If you boiled the water for your brine, let it stand until it's about room temperature either on the bench top or in the fridge.
- Once at room temperature pour the brine into the fermentation vessel and push everything down with a potato masher or something. Clean hands also work.
- Cover with the cabbage leaves.
- Top either some fermenting weights, a heavy bowl or a clean rock on top to weight everything down.
- Close the vessel and store in a dark corner for a few weeks depending on temperature.

> [!info] Temperatures for fermenting
> 
> Warmer temperatures will speed up fermentation, cooler temperatures will slow down fermentation, so:
> - At 21Â°â€“23Â°C sauerkraut will be done in 3-4 weeks.
> - At 15Â°â€“18Â°C sauerkraut will be done in about 6 weeks.
