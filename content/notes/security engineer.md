As a security engineer my main role is *enabling* engineering teams to make good decisions about how to build and maintain adequately secure systems.

I'm currently focused on app security and developing a security partnerships program and as clich√© as it sounds there is no "typical day" for me and it's largely shaped by the needs of the engineering group I work with. 

Generally, it can be largely be split into three or four general categories:
- **Operational work**, this is work that keeps the Application Security teams lights on for example vulnerability management, consulting with engineers very broadly, creating and tuning automations to streamline automation all of which takes up about 30-50% of my time during a given week.

The rest of my time is spent helping the group I am working with reach their end goal which can be shipping a product or feature, this can be broken up into more discreet responsibilities like:
- **Building relationships and consulting with engineering**, which primarily sees me talking to engineers about the problems they are having and helping them identify if changes will likely result in more or less security risk and identifying ways to manage this. I also have to speak to group leads about how security is functioning and if there are any significant concerns we need to work on addressing.
- **Research & development**, while a lot of this happens as a consequence of daily activities there are lots of times I need to go out and do additional research. Sometimes this means building a minimal viable product to demonstrate a vulnerability, or it can mean reading industry standards and identifying how they apply to the context we're operating in.
- **Strategy & planning**, while a lot of day to day security engineering is reactive, there is also the general need to build out plans in anticipation of future needs, this can be finding ways to scale yourself through self-service, writing guidelines and processes or helping engineering teams build secure development practices into their everyday delivery.
