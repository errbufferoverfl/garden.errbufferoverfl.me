While there are no hard or fast rules to using a [[notes/polyculture|Polyculture]] there are common practices that can be implemented depending on the plants, spatial distribution and time spent cohabiting.

## Annual Polycultures

### Intercropping

A technique where two or more crops are grown in a space where they overlap with each other â€“ for example growing maize, beans and squash together, a combination often referred to as "the three sisters".
- The maize provides a structure for the beans to grown on;
- The beans provide nitrogen for all of the plants; and,
- The squash suppresses weeds on the ground.

Legumes are often intercropped because they fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil a process known as nitrogen fixation.

### Cover Cropping

When a crop alongside another plant that is not being used as a crop, this is known as cover cropping. The plant doesn't need to provide "cover" per se, it can also be used to prevent soil erosion, suppress weeds, improve water retention, and in the case of legumes, provide nitrogen fixation.
### Strip Cropping

Resembles [[companion planting]] where different plants are grown in alternative rows. For example, strip cropping carrots and onions; the onion smell puts off carrot root fly, while the smell of carrots puts off onion fly.

They don't always need to be companions, but they can provide other benefits like preventing soil erosion and aiding with nutrient cycling. 

## Integrated Aquaculture

A form of aquaculture where cultures of fish or shrimp are grown together with seaweed, shellfish or micro-algae. 

In a traditional monoculture the harvesting of seaweed crops releases nitrates into the water and can lead to severe [[eutrophication]] as seen in the Venice Lagoon.

In integrated aquaculture plants serve not only as food for the animals, but also as a water filtration device for the surrounding environment absorbing nitrates and excess carbon dioxide (like an [[aquarium-algae-scrubber|Algae Scrubber]]).
