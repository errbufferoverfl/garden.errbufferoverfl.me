[Holepunch](https://github.com/holepunchto) is a company and suite of tools that "equips developers with a powerful suite of independent components to effortlessly construct peer-to-peer applications."

A Holepunch stack can be broken up into three parts:

## Building Blocks

- [hypercore](hypercore.md)
- [hyperbee](hyperbee.md)
- [hyperdrive](hyperdrive.md)
- [autobase](autobase.md)
- [hyperdht](hyperdht.md)
- [hyperswarm](hyperswarm.md)

keet.io is a peer to peer chat that is built entirely on Holepunch.
