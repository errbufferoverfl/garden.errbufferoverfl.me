Structural adjustment programs are a [[notes/neocolonialism|neocolonist]] tool that sets out a set of economic reforms that a country must adhere to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund and/or the World Bank.

These reforms have been in place since the 1940s but there was a significant push in the 1980s as part of a push to lend to "crisis-stricken poor" countries.

Countries engaged in structural adjustment programs have been required to perform some combination of the following: 

- Devaluing their currencies to reduce balance of payments deficits. 
- Cutting public sector employment, subsidies, and other spending to reduce budget deficits.
- Privatising state-owned enterprises and deregulating state-controlled industries.
- Easing regulations in order to attract investment by foreign businesses.
- Closing tax loopholes and improving tax collection domestically.

While there was a reduction in applying structural adjustment in the 2000 it returned to normal levels in 2014. 

Structural adjustment loans cannot be spent on health, development or education programs.[^1]

The following countries are currently distributed in East and South Asia, Latin America, and Africa. including Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sudan, Zimbabwe and India.
