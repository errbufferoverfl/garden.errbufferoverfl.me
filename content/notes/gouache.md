Gouache is a water based medium made of pigment, water and a binding agent, normally gum arabic or dextrin. 

Gouache is similar to watercolour in that it can be re-hydrated and it infuses with the paper. While it also possesses qualities similar to that of acrylic and oil paint in that it's used for opaque painting styles.

> Wet and dry gouache will have different values with lighter tones drying darker, and darker tones drying lighter, however, this is not a universal rule and it's important to swatch your colours before painting.
