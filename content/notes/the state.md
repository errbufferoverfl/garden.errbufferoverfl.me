The "state" is a centralised political organisation that imposes and enforces rules over a population within a territory.

Walter Scheidel an Austrian historian maintains that most modern definitions of the state have the following in common:
- Centralised institutions that impose rules;
- Back these rules up by force;
- Within a territorially circumscribed population; 
- With a distinction between the rulers and the ruled; 
- Includes an element of autonomy, stability, and differentiation.
