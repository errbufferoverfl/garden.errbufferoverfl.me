An algae scrubber is a water filtering device thats used to grow algae, which in the process, filters undesirable chemicals like nitrate, phosphate, nitrite, ammonia, ammonium from the water.

> [!info] Sizing
> 10 cm x 10 cm can generally handle ~200 litres of water

## What you need

- A black basket or container (no holes)
- Cable ties
- Course grit sandpaper
- An air stone that stone should span the width of the container
- Air line suction cups
- Air line hose suitable for the air stone
- Plastic knitting canvas
- Low energy light source (LED of CFL)

## Tools

- Drill
- Ruler

## Instructions

- Cut the top three quarters of off, ideally, it's about double the hight of the airstone you bought.
- Cut the knitting mesh to fit the inner dimensions of your container. Be sure to subtract about an inch or two off the height, leaving enough room for the air stone to sit attached underneath.
- Give the knitting mesh a once over with the course grit sandpaper so both sides are rough to the touch, this will help the algae affix itself to the canvas.
- Give the plastic canvas a rinse to get all the debris off so it doesn't end up in the fish tank.
- Cut two notches at the top and bottom of the knitting mesh, these will be used to affix the mesh to the top of the container and the airstone.
- At the bottom of the mesh affix the airstone using two cable ties like so:

> [!note]
> You'll want to make sure you have a clearance of about 2cm at the bottom, so the mesh and airstone can move freely

- Next we want to drill some holes in the basket so we can connect everything together.
	- At the top on the container drill two holes on the outer edge, these will be used to affix the knitting mesh to the container.
	- In between these two holes drill three more, equally spaced which will be the primary water inlets.
	- Cut 3 holes, evenly spaced at the bottom, this will form an outlet.
	- Drill 4 holes, 2 on either side of the container, which will be used to attach the suction cups to the Algae scrubber.
