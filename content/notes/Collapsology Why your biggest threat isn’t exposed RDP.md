For decades, anthropologists, quantitative historians, and sociologists have discussed and proposed various explanations for the collapse of civilizations, from unsustainable complexity, decay of social cohesion, rising inequality and general misfortune.  
  
Using our time-travelling phone booth, we’ll investigate historical collapses and conduct a root cause analysis to investigate why these collapses happened, and how we can observe similar issues in modern business environments.  
  
This talk provides an overview of how to identify cultural threats in a rapidly evolving business landscape, and how we can use modern-day tools to identify these threats before they result in security culture collapse.
