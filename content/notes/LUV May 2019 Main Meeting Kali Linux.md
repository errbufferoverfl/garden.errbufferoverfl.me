Come together in ritual to learn about KALI LINUX! A Debian based Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking distribution, with over 600 pre-installed packages. In this talk errbufferoverfl will cover as many things as she can fit into an hour, from port scanning, to web application hacking to exploit pewpewpewing. We'll be looking at some of the more popular tools available within the distribution including nmap, Burp Suite Community Edition, John the Ripper and many others. She will also discuss the phases we go through when conducting a security assessment from recon to exploitation and where these tools can be leveraged. Tonight, for one night only no server, or web application is sacred.
