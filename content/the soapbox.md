**Collapsology: Why Exposed RDP Isn’t Your Biggest Threat**
> For decades, anthropologists, quantitative historians, and sociologists have discussed and proposed various explanations for the collapse of civilizations, from unsustainable complexity, decay of social cohesion, rising inequality and general misfortune.  
> 
> Using our time-travelling phone booth, we’ll investigate historical collapses and conduct a root cause analysis to investigate why these collapses happened, and how we can observe similar issues in modern business environments.  
> 
> This talk provides an overview of how to identify cultural threats in a rapidly evolving business landscape, and how we can use modern-day tools to identify these threats before they result in security culture collapse.
